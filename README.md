# 📦 KAFKA-Guide

A lightweight Kafka integration toolkit for building scalable, event-driven applications. Includes producer/consumer templates, topic management utilities, and real-world examples for stream processing and microservice orchestration.

---

## 🧠 What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. It enables applications to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time.

## 📸 Kafka Architecture

![Kafka Architecture](https://www.cloudduggu.com/kafka/architecture/kafka_architecture.png)  
*Source: [CloudDuggu](https://www.cloudduggu.com/kafka/architecture/)*

Kafka consists of:
- **Producers**: Send records to Kafka topics.
- **Consumers**: Read records from topics.
- **Topics**: Categories to which records are sent.
- **Brokers**: Kafka servers that store and forward data.
- **Zookeeper**: Manages cluster metadata and leader election.

## 📚 Real-World Examples

- 🛒 **E-commerce Order Pipeline**: Track orders, payments, and delivery events.
- 🚗 **Fleet Tracking System**: Stream GPS data from vehicles.
- 🧾 **Audit Logging**: Capture user actions across microservices.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

- Integrate with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**
- Use **Kafka Manager** or **Confluent Control Center** for cluster insights

---

## 🧰 Utilities

- `topic-create.sh`: Create topics with replication and partitions
- `topic-list.sh`: List all topics
- `topic-delete.sh`: Delete a topic safely

---

## 🧠 Kafka Concepts Explained

| Concept         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Partition**   | Unit of parallelism in a topic |
| **Offset**      | Position of a message in a partition |
| **Consumer Group** | Multiple consumers sharing a topic |
| **Retention**   | Duration messages are stored |
